# User Tool Execution Preferences

- **pnpm check**: Always confirm with the user before executing `pnpm check`.
- **Git Commands**: Always confirm with the user before executing any `git` command (including `git status`, `git diff HEAD`, `git log -n 3`), unless explicitly instructed to run them without confirmation.
